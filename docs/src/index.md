# Introduction

NaiveNASflux is an extension of [NaiveNASlib](https://github.com/DrChainsaw/NaiveNASlib.jl) which adds primitives for [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) layers so that they can be used in a computation graph which NaiveNASlib can modify. Apart from this, it adds very little new functionality.

## Reading Guideline

Due to how NaiveNASflux just glues Flux and NaiveNASlib, most of the things one can use NaiveNASflux for is described in the [documentation for NaiveNASlib](https://DrChainsaw.github.io/NaiveNASlib.jl/stable).

The [Quick Tutorial](@ref) gives an overview of some basic operations while the [Model Pruning Example](@ref) show simple usage without bringing in full fledged neural architecture search.

The API reference is split up into categories in an attempt to make it easy to answer "how do I achieve X?"-type questions.
